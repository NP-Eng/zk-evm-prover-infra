Test to prove the 6000 erigon/cancun test blocks [shared](https://0xpolygon.slack.com/archives/C03U6TXP2EM/p1722897648896069) by John.

1. Deploy the whole stack with 4 workers and one highmem node pool.

Use `c3d-highmem-60` to have 480GB of memory to avoid hitting too many out-of-memory errors.

2. Download the witnesses.

Download the archive locally using Google Drive before copying it to the Jumpbox pod.

```bash
kubectl cp ~/Downloads/mega-witness.json.bz2 "$jumpbox_pod_name":/opt --namespace zk-evm
```

Then connect to the jumpbox pod and decompress the archive. You should obtain a huge json file.

```bash
bzip2 --decompress /opt/mega-witness.json.bz2
```

3. Start proving the witnesses.

```bash
env RUST_BACKTRACE=full \
  RUST_LOG=info \
  leader \
  --runtime=amqp \
  --amqp-uri=amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq-cluster.zk-evm.svc.cluster.local:5672 \
  stdio < /opt/mega-witness.json | tee /opt/mega-witness.json.leader.out
```

As soon as you run the command, it should output a bunch of logs saying it's attempting to prove the different blocks.

```bash

2024-08-08T13:27:26.569895Z  INFO prover: Proving block 2
